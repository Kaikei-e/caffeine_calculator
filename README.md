# caffeine_calculator
#### This is a simple program that calculates the decay of caffeine and draws it in matplotlib.
#### There are two types of caffeine_calculators: one uses the amount of caffeine per 100 ml, and the other has the same function as number one plus calculates from the total amount of caffeine. The second is named 2mode_cal.
#### 2mode_cal calculates caffeine decay from two methods: Mode1 uses the total volume of the drink and the amount of caffeine per 100ml, Mode2 uses only the total amount of caffeine.
## How to use it
#### Enter the amount of the drink that you have drunk and the amount of caffeine per 100 ml in one line, separated by a space.
#### Or you can just enter the caffeine amount.
