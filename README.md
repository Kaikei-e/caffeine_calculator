# Caffeine Calculator
#### This is a simple program that calculates caffeine attenuation and draws it with matplotlib.
#### There are three types of caffeine_calculators, the first one uses the amount of caffeine per 100ml, the second one has the same function as the first one plus it calculates from the total amount of caffeine. The second one is called 2mode_cal and the third one is called chronologiCal. chronologiCal is a time-series version of 2mode_cal for multiple drinks. 

#### The second one is called 2mode_cal. 2mode_cal calculates caffeine decay in two ways: Mode1 uses the total amount of caffeine in the drink and the amount of caffeine per 100ml, Mode2 uses only the total amount.

#### For chronologiCal, first enter the number of drinks you want to calculate, and then enter the date and time in any order you like.  Then you can do the same thing as 2mode_cal.

## The usage is as follows.
#### Enter the amount of drinks consumed and the amount of caffeine per 100ml on a single line, separated by spaces.
#### Alternatively, you can just enter the amount of caffeine.
